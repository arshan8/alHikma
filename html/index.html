      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We are on the Mission to promote inclusive development by educating and skilling
        underprivileged children through easy access to quality education. This is to achieve rapid
        educational transformation in the weaker sections of society who usually cannot afford the
        expenses of educating their children. We aim at providing quality education in line with the
        CBSE & ISC Curriculum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the students come from the underprivileged and deprived section of society, they are also
        malnourished and unkempt; hence <strong>Al Hikmah</strong> also aims at improving their health
        and hygiene by providing healthy food with a balanced diet and self-care training. These
        children and their families cannot even afford basic food, clothing, and other necessities.
        At <strong>Al Hikmah Institute</strong>, our mission is to provide good food, clothing, medical
        facilities, self-care and self-defense training, and other essential facilities that bring
        holistic development within them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to work on social problems such as child marriage, sexual violence, lack of awareness
        about menstrual hygiene and child labour, drug addiction, and exposure to drug environments
        faced by children of marginalized communities.

      <h2>para 1</h2>
      <p>
        Initially what was merely a vision to us—and a frivolous notion for others—<strong>Al Hikmah
        Institute</strong> started with just 44 orphan kids in a 1,269-square-foot apartment. After
        relentless toiling, land was taken on lease and that commitment has transpired into a
        16,552.8-square-foot premises that imparts quality education and holistic nourishment of both
        body and mind to more than 350 destitute and helpless children.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is after two years of rigorous and selfless hard work that we now seek to purchase two acres
        of land upon which we have laid the foundation of a residential school—one that will comprise
        a full school building and related facilities.
